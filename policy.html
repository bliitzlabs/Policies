                    Your privacy is important to us, and we are committed to protecting the personal information you provide while using our App. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and secure your information, and how we respect your choices and rights regarding your personal data. By using the App, you consent to the practices described below and are encouraged to review this policy carefully.
                </div>

                <h2 class="section-title">Information We Collect</h2>
                <p class="section-content">
                    We collect information in several categories to provide a safe, personalized, and functional experience. The types of information we collect depend on how you use the App and the permissions you grant. We also collect certain information automatically to ensure proper operation and improvement of the App.
                </p>

                <h3 class="section-subtitle">Information You Provide Directly</h3>
                <p class="section-content">
                    When you sign in using Google or Facebook, we receive only the information that you choose to share with the App, such as your name, email address, profile picture, and public account information depending on your privacy settings. This information is used exclusively to create and personalize your in-App profile and to enable social features. We do not collect your contacts, private account details, or phone number unless voluntarily provided by you through the login service.
                </p>

                <h3 class="section-subtitle">Location Information</h3>
                <p class="section-content">
                    With your consent, the App may access your device's location. You have full control over this setting and may deny permission or manually select a location at any time. We only collect your approximate or precise location once when granted or the location you manually choose within the App. This information is used to display relevant links, groups, and other content based on your region. We do not perform background location tracking or continuous monitoring.
                </p>

                <h3 class="section-subtitle">Preferences and Profile Settings</h3>
                <p class="section-content">
                    The App collects the preferences and settings you manually select, including interests, categories, personalization choices, and content filtering settings. This data is used to provide a more tailored experience, improve recommendations, and ensure that the content displayed is relevant to your selections. This information is stored securely and is never shared externally except to sync with your account across devices.
                </p>

                <h3 class="section-subtitle">Automatically Collected Technical Data</h3>
                <p class="section-content">
                    We may automatically collect technical data such as your device type, operating system version, App version, crash logs, and anonymous usage analytics. This information helps us diagnose issues, improve performance, and enhance security. Some of your data may also be used to deliver personalized advertisements within the App to ensure ads are relevant and meaningful. No advertising identifiers or device IDs are collected for tracking outside of the App.
                </p>

                <h2 class="section-title">How We Use Your Information</h2>
                <p class="section-content">
                    The information collected is used strictly to provide, operate, and improve the App. This includes managing your profile, personalizing your feed, showing relevant content and groups, and enabling location-based services. At all times, your data is handled responsibly and is not sold or rented to third parties.
                </p>

                <h2 class="section-title">How We Store and Protect Your Information</h2>
                <p class="section-content">
                    We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your data from unauthorized access, misuse, or disclosure. Personal information is stored in encrypted databases, and communications with the App are secured via HTTPS and TLS. Access to your data is restricted to authorized personnel only, and we continuously monitor our systems for vulnerabilities. Data is retained only as long as your account is active or required to comply with legitimate operational or legal obligations.
                </p>

                <h2 class="section-title">Sharing and Disclosure of Information</h2>
                <p class="section-content">
                    Your information may be shared only in limited circumstances: with trusted service providers necessary for authentication, cloud storage, analytics, or security; if required by law; or to prevent fraud, abuse, or security threats. We do not share your information with advertisers, data brokers, or external marketing platforms outside of the personalized in-App ads described above.
                </p>

                <h2 class="section-title">Your Rights and Choices</h2>
                <p class="section-content">
                    You have full control over your personal information and can access, update, or delete your account and data at any time. You can also withdraw consent for location tracking, adjust preferences, and disable notifications. Denying permissions may limit certain features, but the App will remain functional within those limits.
                </p>

                <h2 class="section-title">Children’s Privacy</h2>
                <p class="section-content">
                    The App is not intended for users under 13 years of age, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we discover that we have inadvertently collected data from a child under 13, we will take immediate steps to delete it.
                </p>

                <h2 class="section-title">Third-Party Links and Services</h2>
                <p class="section-content">
